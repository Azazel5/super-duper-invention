        Chromecast is a line of digital media players developed by Google.
        The devices, designed as small dongles, enable users with a mobile device or personal computer
        to initiate and control playback of Internet-streamed audio-visual content on a high-definition
        television or home audio system through mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology.
        The first-generation Chromecast, a video streaming device, was announced on July 24, 2013, and made
        available for purchase on the same day in the United States for US$35.[4] The second-generation Chromecast
        and an audio-only model called Chromecast Audio were released in September 2015. A model called Chromecast
        Ultra that supports 4K resolution and high dynamic range was released in November 2016. Critics praised the
        Chromecast simplicity and potential for future app support. The Google Cast SDK was released on February 3,
        2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to work with Chromecast and other Cast receivers. According
        to Google, over 20,000 Google Castâ€“ready apps are available, as of May 2015. Over 30 million units have sold globally
        since launch, making the Chromecast the best-selling streaming device in the United States in 2014, according to NPD Group.
        From Chromecast launch to May 2015, it has handled more than 1.5 billion stream requests.</string>
